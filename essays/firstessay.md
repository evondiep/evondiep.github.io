I was initially very indecisive when it came down to choosing a major. I knew that I liked marketing but that alone didnâ€™t seem to fulfill me. I was always interested in the Management Information Systems major and the tech side of things, however, I was also very intimidated by it. Eventually, I decided that it was a challenge that I wanted to overcome. Technology continues to impact and change our lives everyday and learning to code is a very useful skill. I am looking forward to learning more in this class and major as a whole.
