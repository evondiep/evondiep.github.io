Because Invoice 2 was the last WOD I completed, it will be the one that I will be discussing about in this essay. Invoice 2 involved adding on a few more features to Invoice 1 by using Javascript expressions to create a sales receipt. In this WOD, the main tasks were to create a line on the receipt for our shipping cost, calculate the shipping cost according to the given set of conditions, and change the code so that the total would include the subtotal, tax, and shipping amounts. Here is the link to the WOD for further details: <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/070.flow-control-I/experience-invoice2.html"></a>

I felt that I performed well on this WOD as I was able to complete it in a little over 11 minutes (average time) on my first attempt. I think a big part of this was that this WOD was just a small extension of the previous WOD, Invoice 1. The trickiest part was probably creating the if statement for the different shipping conditions. However, I felt that the shipping conditions were pretty straightforward so I was able to figure it out relatively quickly. I think this was largely possible because I reviewed the readings beforehand, so I had a pretty good idea of how if-statements work. I also read the instructions over and over again until I felt that I really understood what was being asked. Since nothing really slowed me down in Invoice 2, I can discuss what slowed me down in Invoice 1. Invoice 1 had a lot of steps and I stumbled on certain parts due to careless mistakes. One of these was forgetting to change the content of certain strings for the given variables, so when I refreshed the page, it remained the same.

As mentioned previously, the things I mainly did to prepare for this WOD included reviewing the readings and the instructions. This helped me plan out an idea in my head of what I expect to do for each step before actually doing it. I don’t think I did anything differently compared to the last WOD in terms of preparation since I did a thorough review for that one too.

I think I prepared to the best of my ability for Invoice 2 since it went smoothly and was pretty short. I could have prepared better for Invoice 1 since there were more steps. Although I thought I looked through the instructions pretty thoroughly before starting, I still made a few minor errors when I recorded my WOD. I think I can do a better job at looking at the included code that we copy and paste in the instructions since it’s easy to overlook that. That way, I can avoid making the same mistake mentioned earlier, regarding forgetting to replace strings assigned to the given variables. Something I would try differently for the next WOD is using live-server instead of http-server since I notice that that’s what is used in the screencast solutions. That would probably make my WOD time a little faster.
