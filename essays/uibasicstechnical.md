When I started Browser History 1, I was able to create the index.html file, rename the title and top level section to “A history of web browsers,” run http-server to view the page, and create the four subsections using H2 tags. I then got stuck at the part where we had to create the links to an external web page because I forgot about the href attribute that goes after </a/>. I viewed the next step which was to create a table of contents. I had also forgotten what the syntax looked like for this. I had to stop my recording and reviewed the resource to see the syntax, and I also watched the screencast. I attempted the WOD again and was able to complete it in 19 minutes, which falls under the average amount of time. Although I thought the tasks were relatively simple, they were also pretty tedious (e.g., inserting the paragraph tags in the right place to preserve the paragraphs).

I went into Browser History 2 thinking it would be fast to complete since it looked shorter than Browser History 1. However, I ran into a problem that caused me to be stuck on this WOD for over 3 hours. I started off by copying the index.html made in the previous WOD and pasting it into the Browser History 2 folder. After creating the style.css file, I attempted to link this to my index.html. I then went into the style.css file and tried to change a feature such as the font color. I ran the page and saw no changes. I kept trying to change different features, making sure to save in VS Code, however, every time I refreshed the page, I still saw no changes. I then viewed the screencast and tried to copy the video step by step. However, my browser was still not displaying my changes. I continued to delete and edit my code and googled why my style.css and index.html weren’t linking properly. After many hours of frustration, I came across a forum that suggested using command + shift + R to refresh the page. I had been using command + R to refresh the entire time prior to this. I tried command + shift + R and it worked! My changes were finally showing up. I was finally able to complete this WOD successfully in a little under 6 minutes, which was the Rx time. I think part of the reason I was able to do this so fast was from having stared at the code from the screencast for so long while I was trying to debug.

For Browser History 3, I was stuck from the first step at having to change the layout to make the sections appear side by side. I was not sure how to go about that so I watched the screencast. I followed the steps in the screencast and was able to get it to look like the given example. I then deleted this code and redid it again without the screencast. I was able to complete this WOD in a little under 10 minutes, which was the Rx time.
